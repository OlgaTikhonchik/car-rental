# The application consists of 3 pages:\

1. "/" - the homepage with a general description of the services provided by the

company.

2. "/catalog" - a page containing a catalog of cars with various

configurations that users can filter by brand, hourly rental price, and mileage
driven by the car during its use.

3. "/favorites" - a page with listings that have

been added to the user's favorites.

Navigation: Our app offers seamless navigation with three main pages - Home,
Catalogue, and Favorites, all implemented using routing.

Home Page: On the Home page, you'll find a comprehensive description of our car
rental service. We provide an overview of what sets us apart and why you should
choose us for your car rental needs.

Catalogue Page: The Catalogue page showcases an array of available vehicles. You
can scroll through the catalog and load more car cards using the "Load More"
button. When you reach the end of the catalog, the button disappears, indicating
that you've seen all the available options.

Favorite Cars: Each car card on the Catalogue page has a heart-shaped button
that allows you to add the car to your Favorites. This feature helps you keep
track of the vehicles you're interested in. The Favorites page stores all the
car cards you've added to your Favorites. This helps you quickly access and
compare your preferred vehicles.
